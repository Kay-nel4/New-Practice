Hello this is just practice to make sure I remember what I am doing.
This is currently untracked
I will begin tracking now.

So I am now tracking a new branch I just made called practiceTest!

I must create another new commit just to make sure!:
Ok one more line.
I just want to add a few new possible commits.
Hello Just another practice commit. I Just want to be super ready and 
well practiced for everything.
I think this practice is helping, right now its just repeatition.
Hello I just want to make sure I am on branch practiceTwo.
I am adding some lines just to track and maybe merge?
I might add just one more line before I merge... Just really want 
make sure I understand everything and then move on.
Possible look ahead or maybe do some prep work.

Hello again its Sunday and I just wanted to practice a quick merge I dont think i am going to branch today. Well maybe later but for now this is just on the main branch.
So just a quick practice.
