Hello this is just practice to make sure I remember what I am doing.
This is currently untracked
I will begin tracking now.

So I am now tracking a new branch I just made called practiceTest!

I must create another new commit just to make sure!:
Ok one more line.
I just want to add a few new possible commits.
Hello Just another practice commit. I Just want to be super ready and 
well practiced for everything.
I think this practice is helping, right now its just repeatition.
